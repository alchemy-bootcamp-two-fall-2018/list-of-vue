## Code Wars

## Lab

Create a vuejs app that displays a list of items and allows user to select on of the items. You
get to choose your own domain topic, however take a look at requirements to help guide your choice.

## Components

Basic component structure (use real domain names):

```
App
 |
 +- Items
 |
 +- Detail
```

## Items

Pick a domain topic of interest. Limited requirements:

* Has at least three properties
* Find some image sources

## Functionality

1. ~~Create dummy data with at least 3-4 items and return as `data` of `App`~~
1. ~~`Detail` component should have different render until item is selected.~~
1. ~~Pass callback function `onSelect` to list that changes the `Detail` component~~
1. BONUS: 
    * Show selected item in list
    * Add another component that allows adding a new Item
        * Pass `onAdd` from `App`
        * Add form (`v-on:submit.prevent="..."`)
        * Use `items.push(newItem)` in `App`
