This lab was challenging. I was able to put together a list of items with selected status, etc., but needed to rely heavily on the Pirate example. I understand the general concepts of components, how they relate as parent/children, binding elements, etc. but would not be able to put something like this together on my own currently. 

I was able to make some things 'custom', like giving the text in the selected item it's own color, and was happy to see that code work.

In summary, I think I'm understanding the theory of how Vue works and the overall concept, but the exact syntax and where to place what is still a bit murky.
